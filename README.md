Documentation is still **in-progress**. I'm constantly working on the documentation.  
By the way you can click to edit buttons and help me in improving documentation.
{% endhint %}

Because a good documentation helps everyone who uses **wponion-framework** and eases getting started with it. It's also useful for wider adoption of wponion framework. Many developers will just skip softwares that have no extensive documentations or that doesn't seem to provide quick solutions for their problems.

## So, What is WPOnion exactly?

WPOnion is a simple yet powerful framework that helps developers build custom meta boxes and custom fields in WordPress fast and easily.

The framework lets you define custom meta boxes and custom fields via arrays and handles everything behind the scene automatically. It has a wide range of field types, field settings and supports not only post meta but also term meta, user meta, comment meta, settings pages and custom tables.
